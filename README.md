My professional website. This is version 0.5, with repository name change and a bunch of other static hosting goodies to come shortly, so it's not up on the web yet. But when it is, it'll be at [emilyaviva.com](http://emilyaviva.com).

Using [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) and [Typography.js](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/)

## Running in development
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Navigate your web browser to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
