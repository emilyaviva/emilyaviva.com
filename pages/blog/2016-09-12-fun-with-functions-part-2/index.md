       Fun with functions, part 2: Arrow functions
---
A preliminary note: Arrow functions are part of the ES2015 version of the JavaScript language ([somewhat incorrectly](https://medium.com/@jayphelps/please-stop-referring-to-proposed-javascript-features-as-es7-cad29f9dcc4b) known as "ES6"), but you can still use them natively in [many, but not all, modern browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=arrow%20functions). However, to maximize portability, it's still necessary to use a transpiler like [Babel](https://babeljs.io).
